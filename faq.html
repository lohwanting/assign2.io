  <p><b><i>1. Can i bring a guest to the club?</b></i>
<br>
<br>
Absolutely! We understand that one of the best ways to stay with a healthy lifestyle is to train with a buddy. You can bring a friend for a one-time visit only. If you wish to do so, you must book them in. You can do this by speaking to one of our friendly Membership Consultants.</p>
<p><b><i>2. What are the club opening hours?</b></i>
<br>
<br>
You have the flexibility of being able to workout any time, day or night. You can usually start exercising from as early 6am to as late as 11pm weekdays*, 7am to 9pm on weekends* and Public Holidays are generally 9am to 8pm*. It's best to check with your club for exact opening times.
</p>
<p><b><i>3. Are there any social events for members and staff?</b></i>
<br>
<br>
Yes, they're great fun and an excellent way of getting to know everyone. To find out more about our fitness challenges, special themed classes, or club events, just keep an eye on the member notices around the club.
